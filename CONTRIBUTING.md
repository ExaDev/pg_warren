# Contributing to pg_warren

pg_warren is a Rust workspace with two crates (DESIGN.md §11):

| Crate | What it is | Postgres needed to test? |
|---|---|---|
| `crates/warren-core` | The domain: CSR, traversal, compute kernels. No Postgres dependency. | No |
| `crates/pg_warren` | The pgrx extension: the Postgres adapter around `warren-core`. | Yes |

## Prerequisites

- Rust stable (pinned by `rust-toolchain.toml`; rustup picks it up).
- PostgreSQL 15–18 with server dev headers (`postgresql-server-dev-NN` on
  Debian/Ubuntu), plus `clang` / `libclang-dev` for pgrx's bindgen.
- cargo-pgrx, at exactly the version the extension uses:

  ```sh
  cargo install cargo-pgrx --version 0.19.3 --locked
  cargo pgrx init --pg16 "$(command -v pg_config)"   # or /usr/lib/postgresql/16/bin/pg_config
  ```

  You can init several majors at once (`--pg15 ... --pg17 ...`).

## Running the checks

These are the same checks CI runs (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`). Run them before
you push.

```sh
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo clippy -p pg_warren --all-targets --features pg_test -- -D warnings
RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc --workspace --no-deps

# Tier 1: domain unit + property tests (no Postgres)
cargo test -p warren-core            # a bare `cargo test` at the root does the same

# Tier 2: in-database tests (#[pg_test]) against a real Postgres
cd crates/pg_warren && cargo pgrx test pg16

# Benches compile (micro-benchmarks run with `cargo bench -p warren-core`)
cargo bench -p warren-core --no-run

# warren-core must never depend on Postgres (DESIGN.md §15.4); this must print nothing
cargo tree -p warren-core -e all | grep -E 'pgrx|pg[-_]sys'
```

`cargo test --workspace` is **not** how to test `pg_warren`: its tests need the
pgrx harness, so always use `cargo pgrx test pgNN` for that crate.

`clippy` and `doc` on `pg_warren` need to find a `pg_config`, either via
`cargo pgrx init` or by setting `PGRX_PG_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/pg_config`
(CI's lint job uses the latter and skips installing cargo-pgrx).

### Running pgrx tests as root (containers, cloud dev boxes)

`cargo pgrx test` runs `initdb` and `postgres`, and both refuse to run as root
(`initdb: error: cannot be run as root`). Use pgrx's built-in `--runas`, which
runs the test cluster as an unprivileged user via `sudo`, with a data
directory that user owns:

```sh
install -d -o postgres -g postgres /tmp/pgrx-pgdata
cd crates/pg_warren
cargo pgrx test pg16 --runas postgres --pgdata /tmp/pgrx-pgdata
```

This needs `sudo` and an existing unprivileged user (the `postgres` user that
the Debian/Ubuntu packages create works). As root, `cargo pgrx init` against a
system `pg_config` prints "Skipping initdb as current user is root user"; that
is expected and harmless.

When **not** root but using a distro-packaged Postgres, `cargo pgrx test`
installs the extension into the system tree, so make it writable once:

```sh
sudo chmod a+rwx "$(pg_config --pkglibdir)" "$(pg_config --sharedir)/extension"
```

## Other PostgreSQL majors

Feature flags `pg15`, `pg16` (default), `pg17`, `pg18` select the major.
`cargo pgrx test pgNN` switches features for you. CI runs the pgrx tests on all
four majors; locally, one is usually enough.

## Docker

`docker/Dockerfile` builds the extension against one major and installs it into
the official `postgres` image for that major:

```sh
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile --build-arg PG_MAJOR=17 -t pg_warren:pg17 .
```

## Engineering conventions

Test-first (red, green, refactor), package-by-feature, and ports and adapters,
with `warren-core` as the domain. The full conventions are in
[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md); they apply to human contributors too. Keep
[DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) current when a design decision changes (§15.5).
