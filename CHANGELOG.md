# Changelog

## 0.2.0 — in development (until M6)

- Named vectors (`vector_from_query`, `vector_const`, `vector_degree`,
  `vector_dense_id`, `vector_values`, `matrix_rows`, `vector_topk`,
  `vector_stats`, `id_map`, `drop_vector`), persisted or transient
  (`persist := false`), with per-vector ownership (`created_by`).
- Compute: semiring `spmv` / `spmm` with masks and accumulation,
  `vector_map` (compiled subset plus executor fallback) and `explain_map`,
  `vector_reduce`, `vector_norm_diff`; `warren.threads` and
  `warren.max_compute_memory`.
- `compact` moves persisted vectors into the new id space.
- `gather`: messages of any SQL type from a query, relation or vector,
  fanned out over the graph and combined per receiver (`collect`, `count`,
  `sum`, `min`, `max`, `first`, `concat`, `bool_or`, `bool_and`).
- Algorithm library in PL/pgSQL over the primitives: `pagerank`
  (personalised by a seed vector), `components_vector`,
  `label_propagation`, `sssp_vector`, `degree_vector`,
  `aggregate_neighbours`.
- Upgrade from 0.1.0: install the new build, then run
  `ALTER EXTENSION pg_warren UPDATE;` in each database before using it.

## 0.1.0 — a usable traversal index

Milestones M0–M3 of DESIGN.md §13.

- Named graphs over user tables (`create_graph`), rebuilt as immutable
  versions (`refresh`) with stable dense ids, staging, promotion, retention,
  `compact`, `diff`, `info`, `grant`/`revoke`, `drop_version`, `drop_graph`.
- Transactional, chunked persistence in extension-owned tables; a staged
  build inside a rolled-back transaction leaves nothing behind.
- int4, int8 and uuid node ids; optional relations and weights; forward and
  reverse CSR.
- Traversal: `bfs`, `neighbours`, `degree`, `has_edge`, `reachable`,
  `reachable_set`, `shortest_path`, `dijkstra`, `components`, typed path
  patterns with `walk` / `warren.step` / `warren.s`, and `last_stats`.
- Backend-local cache with `prewarm` / `evict`.
- Every SQL entry point runs under a pinned `search_path`; source queries run
  as the graph owner under the search path captured at `create_graph`.
- Tested on PostgreSQL 15–18; traversal functions checked against recursive
  CTE oracles.
